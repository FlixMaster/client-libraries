Segment Options
---------------

Segment options convey a way to separate several datapoints into separated set of values. This comes handy when you want to draw several lines from a uniquer data set of datapoints.

Both the ``scale`` and ``transform`` parameters are optionals.

**options:**

``on`` : string
	Defines the property used to split the datapoints. A new set of datapoints is created for each distinct value for the selected property.
``scale`` : function(array datapoint) array
	The scale function is used to transform each segmented data set of datapoints in a new data set.
``transform`` : function(array datapoint) array
	The transform function works on the data orthogonally.
