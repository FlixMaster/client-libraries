# Documentation

The official documentation for the ReportGrid REST APIs is hosted on the [ReportGrid website](http://www.reportgrid.com). However, you may find that some client libraries contain partial documentation in the source code or source code commenting system (Javadoc, Scaladoc, etc.).

If you would like to contribute to the community documentation, please feel free to use [GitHub Wikis](https://github.com/jdegoes/reportgrid-client-libraries/wiki).

# Contributing

We accept community developed patches for both new functionality consistent with our roadmap, and bug fixes. Please [fork](https://github.com/jdegoes/reportgrid-client-libraries/fork) the repository on GitHub and send a [Pull Request](https://github.com/jdegoes/reportgrid-client-libraries/pull/new/master).

# License

The license for all client libraries is modified MIT. These libraries are intended only for the ReportGrid API, so the license adds a clause to the standard MIT license that restricts use of the source code to applications that are built on the ReportGrid platform.
